## 🚀 What Is Tetcore?

Tetcore is not a model.  
Tetcore is not an API.  
Tetcore is not a marketplace wrapper.

Tetcore is a **protocol-grade runtime** that transforms intelligence into a programmable, ownable, economically routable network primitive.

It enables:

- 🔐 Native identity & cryptography (Ed25519-based)
- 🧠 Intelligence Fabric Protocol (IFP)
- 📦 Model registration & shard commitments
- 💰 Deterministic revenue routing
- 📜 Native smart contracts (TCL + TVM)
- 🗳 On-chain governance
- 🔁 Multi-ledger storage architecture
- ⚖️ Deterministic state machine execution

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

Tetcore is composed of modular subsystems:

- **Tetcore Kernel** — Deterministic state transitions  
- **IFP Modules** — Intelligence coordination & economics  
- **TCL + TVM** — Native contract system  
- **Relay Protocol** — Encrypted prompt delivery  
- **Model Vaults** — Staking & participation layer  

The entire system behaves as a compositional state machine:

Δ_total = Δ_kernel ∘ Δ_ifp ∘ Δ_contract ∘ Δ_economics

## 🧠 Intelligence Fabric Protocol (IFP)

IFP defines how intelligence assets operate within Tetcore:

- Prompt commitments  
- Inference receipts  
- Fee markets  
- Revenue routing  
- Shard ownership  
- Vault participation  

IFP makes models:

- Ownable  
- Stakable  
- Economically programmable

## ⚖️ Core Engineering Principles

1. Determinism First  
2. No Floating Point in Consensus Paths  
3. Modular Composability  
4. Explicit Capability Control  
5. Formal Specification Before Implementation

## 🌍 Vision

Intelligence becomes infrastructure.

Not centralized.  
Not opaque.  
Not rent-seeking.  

But programmable, sovereign, and protocol-native.
